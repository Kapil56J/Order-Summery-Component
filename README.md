## What i learned

I learned lot of thigs but apart from this i was incredibly happy to see how much i improved myslef
while making such nice projects. This projcts would've beem struggle a while ago.
After plaing around with color combinations and Hover Effect, flebox properties and trying out things on my own, i belive i'm finally comfortable with handling images, and make them responsive as well!
